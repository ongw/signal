# Signal
We tried to build a leap motion application that allowed deaf users to use sign language to communicate.

# What does the service do?
So far, we've gotten A, B, C, and D done (with some success). We learnt quite a lot over the last 16 hours, learning how to use the Leap Motion API, learnt Javascript, and learnt how to implement a neural network to teach our program the different types of signs for each letter. We also learnt the taste of Soylent, and the various forms that Octocat comes in.

# Features
We used Brain.js to teach program all the gestures we've implemented thus far and anytime the program reads a gesture incorrectly, it will learn to correct itself over time.
